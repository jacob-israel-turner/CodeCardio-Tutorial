# CodeCardio-Tutorial

In this tutorial, I'm going to talk about the basics of using [CodeCardio](codecard.io). CodeCardio was written by [DevMountain](devmounta.in) staff for our [Web-Dev bootcamp](https://devmounta.in/web-immersive) admissions proccess.

The purpose of CodeCardio is to enable its users to strengthen their coding skills.  CodeCardio has a number of JavaScript challenges, built to help you learn the fundamentals of JavaScript.  The site uses a testing system to ensure that you aren't only writing out the code, but you're also arriving to the correct answer.

## Step 1: Register

CodeCardio has three options for registration/authentication: 1) Local(using a username/email/password combination), 2) Facebook oAuth, and 3) Github oAuth.

If you're not familiar with oAuth, it's an open standard for authentication, used across many services.  What that means is, you don't have to take the time to sign in/register with tons of sites.  Instead, you can use one of your current accounts to register/authenticate on many sites.

If you are planning on attending DevMountain, I highly recomment creating a Github account at this point and using it to authenticate for CodeCardio.  After doing this, logging in will be as simple as clicking the little button the right.

## Step 2: Finding Challenges

CodeCardio has challenges and sequences, which are collections of challenges.  You can view any challenge on the site from the [dashboard](https://codecard.io/a/dashboard).  You can also see any sequences on the site.

Clicking on a sequence will bring you to a page where you can view all of the challenges in that sequence. You can access a challenge's page by clicking on the challenge name.

To demonstrate, I have created a sequence with three challenges. This is what my dashboard now looks like:

One the left you can see my new sequence, 'These Questions, Three'.  If I click on the sequence, I will see all of the challenges in the sequence.

As you can see, I have three challenges in my sequence.  Let's start solving them!
